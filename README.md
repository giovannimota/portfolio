# My Portfolio – Built with Next.js 🚀

Welcome to my personal portfolio!

This project showcases my work as a **Front-End Developer** and was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), leveraging modern tools and best practices to deliver a fast, responsive, and accessible experience.

## ✨ About

This portfolio was designed and developed from scratch using:

- **Next.js 15** – Server Components
- **TypeScript** – Strongly typed codebase
- **Vercel** – Production deployment with CI/CD

I use this project to present my professional background, featured projects, and the technologies I work with.

It's also a sandbox where I explore new techniques and frameworks.
